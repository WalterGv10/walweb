# Marketing Campaign Generator

Use this skill to create structured, persuasive, and effective marketing campaigns for your projects.

## 1. Campaign Strategy
Before writing, define:
- **Goal**: (e.g., Traffic, Leads, Sales, Brand Awareness)
- **Target Audience**: Who are they? What is their pain point?
- **Key Message / Offer**: What is the unique value proposition? "Soluciones Digitales que Funcionan".

## 2. Copywriting Frameworks
Choose one based on the goal:

### A.I.D.A. (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action)
- **Attention**: Hook the reader immediately. "Stop losing customers!"
- **Interest**: Elaborate on the problem/solution. "Your website is your 24/7 salesperson..."
- **Desire**: Show the benefit. "Imagine closing deals while you sleep."
- **Action**: Explicit CTA. "Click here to start."

### P.A.S. (Problem, Agitation, Solution)
- **Problem**: State the pain. "Is your website invisible on Google?"
- **Agitation**: Make it hurt. "You're losing money every day your competitors rank higher."
- **Solution**: Offer the fix. "WalWeb gets you on page 1."

## 3. Platform Specifics

### Facebook / Instagram Ads
- **Primary Text**: 125 characters (visible before "See More"). Put the hook here!
- **Headline**: Short & punchy (e.g., "Websites that Sell").
- **Creative**:
    - **Feed**: 1080x1080 (1:1) - High contrast, human faces or clear product demo.
    - **Stories/Reels**: 1080x1920 (9:16) - Fast cuts, vertical video.
- **CTA Button**: Learn More, Book Now, Send Message.

### LinkedIn
- **Tone**: Professional, authoritative, industry-focused.
- **Content**: Case studies, results-driven stats ("Increased leads by 40%").
- **Format**: Carousel (PDF) or single impactful image.

### Twitter / X
- **Focus**: Short, news-worthy, or conversational.
- **Hashtags**: Use 1-2 relevant tags (e.g., #DesarrolloWeb #Guatemala).

## 4. Technical Checklist
- [ ] **UTM Parameters**: Tag your URLs to track sources (e.g., `utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=cpc`).
- [ ] **Pixel/Conversion Tracking**: Ensure the Facebook Pixel or Google Tag is firing on the landing page.
- [ ] **Mobile Optimization**: Verify the landing page loads fast on 3G/4G.
- [ ] **Social Proof**: Ensure the landing page has testimonials/logos near the top.
